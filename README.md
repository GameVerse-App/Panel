A GameVerse project, PteroNode Panel is a continuation and adaptation of both the Pterodactyl Panel and Kubectyl, modified for enhanced compatibility with Kubernetes environments. 

## Disclaimer
Please note that PteroNode is pre-release software and may contain bugs or potentially corrupt data. It should not be used in a production environment without thorough testing. **Use at your own risk!** Be sure to back up all files and database content before using.

## Objective of the Project
PteroNode aims to integrate the robust game server management capabilities of Pterodactyl with the scalable and resilient infrastructure of Kubernetes, offering:
- Faster and more efficient workload management with fewer skill requirements.
- Support for Kubernetes multi-cluster environments.

This initiative continues the work started with Kubectyl, advancing it within the Kubernetes ecosystem to provide an optimized and flexible server management solution.
